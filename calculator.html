      <!-- Explanation to the user of how the calorie counter should be used.-->
      <div class="container using-calc">
        <h3 class="row text-align-center">Using the Calorie Calculator:</h3>
        <calc class="row">
          <p class="col-md-5" id="left">First and foremost, it must be understood that this calculator should only be used as a guide for your daily caloric intake. Many individuals will have to modify their personal caloric intake to better suit their body and needs, so keep in mind you may have to adjust up or down for factors this calorie counter is not equiped to handle.<br><br>Secondly, it's incredibly important to stay away from processed and added sugars. We cannot stress this enough! Do the research and you quickly realize it is quite literally treated as poison once it enters the body. Do yourself a huge favor and get in the mindset now of limiting, or altogether eliminating, processed and added sugars as much as possible. Sugars found naturally in foods like those in  carb sources-week2 (rice, oatmeal, etc) and those found mainly in sugar-rich fruit (apples, bananas, etc) are absolutely fine and should not be worried about.</p>
          <p  class="col-md-5" id="right">Additionally, as a rule of thumb, everyone should be getting at a minimum a 1/2 gram of protein per lb of bodyweight. This is certainly not enough for many individuals, but, acts as a floor to work up from. Our recommendation is around 0.8-1.2 grams of protein per lb of bodyweight for most athletic and lean individuals engaging in frequent moderate to intense exercise. We then recommend distributing the rest of your calories fairly evenly between fats and carbs, with a slight bias to carbs.<br><br>Lastly, keep in mind that the source of calories is also important. We recommend whole, unprocessed foods for a variety of different sources-week2 to help with all your micronutrient needs. This means a number of different meats (ie: sirloin, salmon, chicken, etc), a variety of grains and carbs (ie: rice, potatoes, oatmeal, etc), as well as fruits and vegetables (ie: blueberries, spinach, pumpkin, etc). Everyone's body is different and some individuals have no problem with, and like eating diary products (ie: milk, cheese, etc) - use your own discretion. As for eggs, we love them as a complete amino acid protein, one of the highest quality sources-week2 in our opinion, but some individuals hate them and that's OK. Don't feel pressured to eat or implement any specific foods, or stay away from others. Use your best judgement and refer back to this nutirition guide if necessary.</p>

      <!-- Explanation of gender and activity level. -->

      <div class="container explanation">
        <ul>
          <li  class="container explain" >** Gender: Unfortunately our calculator is limited by the variety of physiology's we were able to program for, male and female. Please select the option which you most closely indentify with - however please understand that this will directly effect your calculated caloric intake, so please be as accurate as possible to your actual physiology.</li>
          <li  class="container explain"" >*** Weekly Activity Level: Sedetary is considered an individual who currently workouts no more than 2 days per week or less. Moderate is considered an individual who currently works out 2-4 times a week.
