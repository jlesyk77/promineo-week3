assignment objectives:

Special Notes:
For this project and all remaining projects, you should have a file called .gitignore in your project directory. In that file you should have a line that says "/node_modules" without the quotes. This tells git to ignore all your node module dependencies when it pushes code to your repo.

You should also have a file called package.json in your project directory. Please make sure this file gets pushed to your Github repo with all your other project files. This file is a manifest or list of all dependencies that your project requires to function properly. With this file someone can clone your repo and then run "npm install" in the project directory and they will automatically download all the node module dependencies needed.

In particular, the graders will be cloning your repo (using git clone https://github.com/YourUserName/YourRepoName) and then installing all the dependencies (using npm install). They can then test your project locally on their machine. It is recommended you run these commands at least for this project to make sure you can clone and run your project locally. If you have trouble doing that, please ask for help before submitting it.

note:
You can also utilize the live-server extension as an alterative should you run into issues installing http-server. Click the extensions icon in Visual Studio Code (VSC) and search for live-server to install it.


MacOS Users:
If you run into permissions errors when installing http-server you may need to run the command like this:sudo npm install -g http-server
At which point you will be prompted for your password. Go ahead and enter your password (even though it looks like nothing is happening) and then press enter.


Instructions:
In Visual Studio Code, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below and ensures that the code compiles and runs as directed.

Comment your code, to prove that you understand what you have written -- this is required!
